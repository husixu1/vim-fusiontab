# Overview

This vim plugin is an ad-hoc solution to make the `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` key works for [UltiSnips][1] and [coc.nvim][2] simultaneously. Actually, [coc-snippets][3] already supports ultisnips-style snippets. But it cannot perform snippet actions (such as post-expand actions and post-jump actions). This snippet is created to solve that issue specifically.
